# Employees App

This project uses the **Hilla** framework, which combines a Spring Boot Java backend with a TypeScript frontend. Hilla enables seamless, type-safe communication between server and client for efficient full-stack development.

## How Hilla Works

- **Backend:** Spring Boot Java services expose endpoints.
- **Frontend:** TypeScript UI (Lit or React) with types generated from Java code.
- **Communication:** Type-safe API calls from frontend to backend, no manual REST API wiring.
