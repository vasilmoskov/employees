To start the application in development mode, import it into your IDE and run the `Application` class. 
You can also start the application from the command line by running: 

```bash
./mvnw
```

To build the application in production mode, run:

```bash
./mvnw -Pproduction package
```

To build a Docker image, run:

```bash
docker build -t my-application:latest .
```

If you use commercial components, pass the license key as a build secret:

```bash
docker build --secret id=proKey,src=$HOME/.vaadin/proKey .
```

## Getting Started

The [Getting Started](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/getting-started) guide will quickly familiarize you with your new
Colleagues App implementation. You'll learn how to set up your development environment, understand the project 
structure, and find resources to help you add muscles to your skeleton â€” transforming it into a fully-featured 
application.
